Data Engineering Practical 1: 
Data Cleaning Basics: Students will learn fundamental data cleaning concepts, such as handling missing values, correcting data types, and standardizing data formats. 
Python Data Manipulation: This task will strengthen the skills in using Python, specifically with libraries like Pandas, to handle and transform datasets. 
Data Quality and Consistency: Understand the importance of clean and consistent data for further processing in data pipelines. 
Scripting for Automation: Creating a reusable Python script to automation, emphasizing reproducibility and efficiency in data engineering workflows.


Assignment Tasks 

Load the Dataset: 
Import the dataset into a Python script and preview the data to understand its structure. 

Identify and Handle Missing Values: 
Check for any missing values in the dataset and handle them by either filling with appropriate defaults or removing rows if necessary. 

Standardize Data Types: 
Ensure all columns have the correct data types (e.g., age as integer, enrollment_date as date). 

Normalize Text Data: 
Standardize text data for consistency, such as making all course names lowercase or title case. 

Filter Unwanted Data: 
Filter out any rows where age is outside a realistic student range (e.g., 18-45). 

Correct Inconsistent Entries: 
For binary columns like is_intern, ensure values are standardized (e.g., "Yes" or "No"). 

Save Cleaned Data: 
Save the cleaned dataset to a new file, ready for ingestion...
